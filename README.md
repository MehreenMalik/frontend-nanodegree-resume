## File details:
### js/helper.js
Within helper.js, you’ll find a large collection of strings containing snippets of HTML. Within many snippets, you’ll find placeholder data in the form of `%data%` or `%contact%`.

Each string has a title that describes how it should be used. For instance, `HTMLworkStart` should be the first `<div>` in the Work section of the resume. `HTMLschoolLocation` contains a `%data%` placeholder which should be replaced with the location of one of your schools.

### Your process:
The resume has four distinct sections: work, education, projects and a header with biographical information. You’ll need to:

1. ResumeBuilder contains four JavaScript objects, each one representing a different resume section. 

  * `bio` contains:
        
            name : string
            role : string

                  location: string
            welcomeMessage: string 
            skills: array of strings
            biopic: string url
            display: function taking no parameters

  * `education` contains:
      
            schools: array of objects with
                 name: string
                 location: string
                 degree: string
                 majors: array of strings
                 dates: string (works with a hyphen between them)
                 url: string (optional)
            onlineCourses: array of objects with
                 title: string
                 school: string
                 dates: string (works with a hyphen between them)
                 url: string
            display: function taking no parameters

  * `work` contains
          
            jobs: array of objects with
                 employer: string 
                 title: string 
                 location: string 
                 dates: string (Can be 'in progress')
                 description: string 
            display: function taking no parameters

  * `projects` contains:

            projects: array of objects with
                  title: string 
                  dates: string (works with a hyphen between them)
                  description: string
                  images: array with string urls
            display: function taking no parameters

2. It Iterates through each javaScript object and appends its information to index.html in the correct section.
